📖 About the Project

The Numerology Web App (Chaldean Method) is an interactive web-based tool that merges ancient numerological wisdom with modern software technology.
It helps users analyze their name and date of birth to uncover meaningful insights about their personality, destiny, and life path.

🔮 What is Chaldean Numerology?

Chaldean Numerology is one of the oldest and most precise systems of numerology, originating in ancient Babylon (Chaldea) over 2,500 years ago.

Unlike the Pythagorean system (which assigns numbers sequentially from 1–9), the Chaldean system assigns specific vibrational values to letters based on sound frequencies and energies.

✴️ How It Works

Converts a person’s name into corresponding numeric vibrations.

Analyzes numbers derived from the date of birth.

Combines both to interpret core numerological values (like Destiny, Personality, and Soul numbers).

Provides personalized insights into strengths, challenges, and potential life directions.

🕰️ Historical Background

The Chaldeans believed that every number has a unique vibrational essence that influences human behavior and destiny.

Their system was a blend of astrology, vibration theory, and mathematics.

Even today, it serves as a tool for self-discovery, guidance, and personal growth.
